## Shard Manager  

### Clear Shards  

You may clear shards from you bags either by number of shards, or by bag slot.  
To clear shards by number, specify the number of shards to clear and click Clear Shards at the bottom of the frame.

To clear shards by bag, select the bag slots to clear from (bag 1 starts with the backpack). All shards in selected bags will be cleared.

###  Fill Bags  

You may move shards to fill bags by selecting the bags you would like to fill. Again, bag 1 is the backpack. Shards will fill from bag 1 to bag 5, from the first slot in the bag to the last.

### Keep Shards  

You may keep shards either by bag, or by total number of shards.  
To keep by number, specify the maximum number of shards to keep. Any quantity of shards greater than this will be cleared, in the order in which they appear in your bags.

To keep shards by bag, select the bag slots to keep shards in (bag 1 starts with the backpack). All shards in selected bags will be kept, all others will be cleared.  

### AutoDelete

The AutoDelete function will clear any shards over a specified number from your bags, automatically!  
When the AutoDelete function triggers, a small frame will pop up with a single button. Simply press the button to delete unwanted shards.  
(Note: AutoDelete will not run while in combat, and will evaluate the number of shards in your bags whenever it detects an inventory change.)  

### Configuration  

Configuration settings for the Shard Manager can be found in the interface menu.  
You may toggle between "by bag" and "by number" (which can also be toggle from the Shard Manager frame).  
To have shards kept or cleared in reverse order, check the Reverse Order option. Shards will now be kept or cleared starting at bag slot 5, and will order from last bag slot to first.  
You may also enable the AutoDelete function, and specify the number of shards. Any number of shards in your bags above this number will trigger the AutoDelete function.
