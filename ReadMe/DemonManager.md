## Demon Manager  

### Summon Demons  

To select the demon to summon, scroll the mouse wheel up or down while hovering over the Summon button.  
For demons that require a shard to summon, the number of shards will appear after the name.  
For demons that require another reagent to summon, the number of that reagent available in inventory will be shown.  
Click the Summon button to begin summoning your favorite friend!

### Sacrifice Demon  

To use the Demonic Sacrifice ability, simply click Sacrifice.  
This button will only be enabled if the Demonic Sacrifice spell is known.  

### Dismiss Demon  

Clicking the Dismiss button will yeet your sidekick back to the Twisting Nether.  
This is equivalent to dismissal by right clicking the demon's portrait.  

### Heal Demon  

Clicking Heal will begin channeling the Health Funnel spell.  
The highest rank of spell trained will be used.  
Make sure your buddy is alive to fight your battles!  

### Configuration  

Configuration settings for the Shard Manager can be found in the interface menu.  
You may enable the use of the Incubus instead of the Succubus by checking the Incubus box.
