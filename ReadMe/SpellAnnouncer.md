## Spell Announcer

### Incoming!  

Spell Announcer will automatically announce some spell casts to party/raid members, or whilst solo.  
Currently announced spells include soulstone (being applied to a player), summoning a player (currently not functional with 'lock cabinets, yet...), and Death Coil.  

### Configuration  

Configuration settings for the Spell Announcer can be found in the interface menu.  
You may choose to announce spells based on the type of group you are in (party, raid or solo).
