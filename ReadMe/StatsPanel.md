## Stats Panel

### Check Yo Numbers  

The stats panel will show you the total number of shards you've burnt through, for healthstones, soulstones, and summoning stones.  
Session numbers will reset every time the UI loads.  
Lifetime numbers will only reset when manually done (right click an icon to reset the counters next to it).  
Click the info button on the App Tray again to close the frame.
